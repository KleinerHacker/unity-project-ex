# usage

### Assembly Window
Open the window via Menu: Window > General > Assembly. Here you can manage easier all project wide assemblies and its dependencies. Additional there are different variants to filter for assemblies.

### Media Window
Open the window via Menu: Window > General > Media. Here you can see all your media assets of your project with a very intelligent filter:
* __Filter by scope__ - Scope consists of multiple pathes in your project to filter e. g. for your project assets and third party assets.
* __Filter by type__ - A type filter for media types. It consists of multiple asset types like prefab, ausio clip, ...

*In future the filter methods are expandable by user itself (saved as project settings).*
